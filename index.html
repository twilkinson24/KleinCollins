               </p>
               <p>Fundraise Genius provides a fundraising software platform (the “<span class="bold">Platform</span>”)
                    that allows participants to effectively manage their fundraising campaign (the “<span
                         class="bold">Campaign</span>”), harness email and SMS communication for outreach, collect
                    donations, and process fundraiser sales for their school, team, event, activity or organization (the
                    “<span class="bold">Beneficiary</span>”). The Platform is accessed via the Fundraise Genius website
                    located at https://www.fundraisegenius.com.

                    2. Requirements and Standards; Acceptance by Fundraise Genius
               </p>
               <p>
                    Access to the Platform is predicated upon your ability to meet – and continuing to meet – all of the
                    requirements and standards delineated in this Agreement, and your acceptance of all of the Terms and
                    Conditions of this Agreement. – Please note that Fundraise Genius reserves the option to review any
                    request to access the Platform and participate in a Campaign, and to deny any request for access,
                    for any reason. If you are a participant in a Campaign subsequent to your acceptance of this
                    Agreement – unless we have denied your request for access, you will receive an account code that
                    will provide backend access to the Platform.
               </p>
               <p>
                    You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself (and any team
                    members for whom you might submit information) during the registration process. If you provide any
                    information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete (or becomes untrue, inaccurate,
                    not current or incomplete) – or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is
                    untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete – we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
                    account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Platform (or any portion thereof). You
                    are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information. You agree to accept
                    responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately
                    by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@fundraisegenius.com">support@fundraisegenius.com</a> of
                    any unauthorized use of your account or any other

                    conjunction with any Campaign or any webpages created on behalf of a Beneficiary – does not

                    into contracts as such as this one due to age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not
